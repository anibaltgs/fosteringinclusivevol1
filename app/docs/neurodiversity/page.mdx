# Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is a concept that recognizes and values the natural diversity in the functioning of the human brain. It refers to the wide variability in cognitive, emotional, and sensory processing abilities that individuals possess. This diversity includes conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, among others, considering them as natural variations in brain function
rather than disorders or diseases to be
corrected. Neurodiversity promotes the
idea that each individual has unique
strengths and challenges and advocates for
the acceptance and inclusion of these
differences in society.
